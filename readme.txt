Give your readers an easier way to embed your infographics (or other images) on their sites, with proper attribution back to you.

== Description ==

With a single URL in an 'Edit Post' page (and no setup), you can automatically add a properly attributed, easy-to-copy embed code to the bottom of your posts. Readers can also edit the width of the image in the embed code to either percent or pixels (the default is 100%).

While it was built with infographics in mind, you can certainly use any image you'd like.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-embed-infographic` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Insert the URL of the image you're using in the 'Infographic Embedder' meta box.
1. Publish or update your post.

== Requirements ==

* jQuery

== Screenshots ==

1. On any post where the Infographic Embed URL is present
2. Meta box on post pages
